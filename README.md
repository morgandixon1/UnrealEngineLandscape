Generating landscape actors with c++ via height map images programmatically

I spent so damn long trying to find any good examples to programatically generate landscape actors based on height maps but I could find nothing! Such a pain.

Because I am using this in a paid plugin I am making I am not spilling all the beans, but since this was such a horrible experience I thought some others may enjoy this. Im sure chat GPT can get you the rest of the way. The main inputs are the image path, and numblocks is the real world scale equivalent IE I have 1 block its x by x size. Hopefully this helps!
